# DIY Chatbot

## Current Functionality:
- Asks for directory, ideally containing PDF files
    - Can handle if the directory is invalid/exists and whether or not it has PDFs in it
- If the directory is valid, it grabs all docs with .pdf and puts it into a list
- Parses the files and pulls all valid text from them
- Tokenizes and cleans the text for use with NLP 

## Planned Functionality:
- Correct tokenization and cleaning of text data to ensure it's being done properly
- Create the NLP ML thingy
- Train the model
- Add front end to be able to ask the model questions
